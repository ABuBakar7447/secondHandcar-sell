## What I have done?
Using reactjs library I have created this website named `SecondHandCar Sale.

## How I have completed this project?
First I have installed react and then created route of my project. Then I have collected api data from mongodb server and load it in my website and using those data and doing some coding I have built this website and every time I have pussed data into my github so that my data get stored in a safe place. 

## Details or feature of my website
 In my website there is 8 page (Home, Blogs, Dashboard(Addproduct, MyProduct, Allseller, Allbuyer, Myorder) Logout, Login, Signup). First page is default webpage or you can go that page by selecting Home or icon button in the header section. In my homepage I have 3 types of brand car and click on them you will redirect to product page of that brand and there you can product details and can book the product . Besides you can go to blog page by selecting blogs button. There you can see some question related answer. There is login and register option.There is Dashborad option but inorder to see that option you have to login. If you log in as seller you will myproduct route and add product route in dashboard.otherwise if you logged in as buyer you can see myorder option. There is a route for admin.
